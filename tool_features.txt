### File to list features of RRBS region finding tools as I test them
# tool = tool name
# multithread_available = Can the tool be multithreaded? no/yes/maybe, maybe for R programs that could maybe be made parallel
# number_steps = number of steps the program requires to give me a list of cpgs; does not include running my allele counting script or making a whitelist
tool	multithread_available	number_steps
methclone	no	1
cgmaptools	no	3
